# AutoConnect
Automatically connect to servers that are full, instead of having to manually spam connect.

## Features
üîÅ Automatically connect to a server until a spot opens up<br>
üîß Adjust amount of seconds to wait before trying again<br>
üìå Saves & reloads options automatically when closing and re-opening the game<br>

## How It Works
AutoConnect will very simply try to connect again if you have been kicked from a server with the "Error: Server full" message. Effectively removing the need to spam-connect on newly wiped servers.
